## Description
This project is part of the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths" target="_blank">Odin Project curriculum</a>.<br>
Itâ€™s a simple message board that marks my first experience with PostgreSQL and deploying both a backend server and a database using <a href="https://railway.app/" target="_blank">Railway</a>.

## Thoughts on the project
Through this project, I learned how to deploy web apps with a backend and database. I chose Railway, mainly for its free initial credits, but I also explored other popular PaaS options. 

Additionally, Iâ€™m getting more comfortable with Node.js and Express, and Iâ€™m really enjoying the process. I used the MVC pattern to structure my code and organize the project effectively.

Looking back, I'm pretty sure Iâ€™ll probably remember this simple project fondly, as it was a key milestone â€”my first time deploying both a backend and database. It feels like a significant step forward in my learning journey.
